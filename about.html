            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Some of my personal interests include traveling, photography and cinematography, music, playing the guitar and trumpet, hiking, the outdoors, and hanging out with my friends. I love music of all kinds, so I started playing the guitar recently. My favorite artists right now are Travis Scott, Mac Miller, A$AP Rocky, Kid Cudi, and Palace. I also like Leon Bridges and plan on going to his concert in November. Back to the outdoors, I am an Eagle Scout and that was one of the most beneficial experiences of my life. It had its tough moments sometimes, but looking back it was enjoyable the whole time. It taught me that life is not glamorous all the time, and I became comfortable in uncomfortable situations.

                As I mentioned earlier, I love sports. I plan on completing a predictive model in python that can predict a player's future WAR. A WAR is a stat in baseball that tells you a player’s value to the team. It compares them to a “replacement player”, or in other words a fictional player that is average. This would be helpful to get a few co-ops I am interested in, too. Such as an Atlanta Braves scouting co-op which requires some coding to filter data a player props. I would love to work in the sports industry so this would be a good chance to break through.
