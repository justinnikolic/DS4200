        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I am a fourth year computer science and business administration major with concentrations in finance and international business. I want to get into project management which combines both my technical skills and interpersonal skills which I have developed throughout my time at university.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am interested in real estate, consulting, project management, product management, software engineering, data analytics, and cyber security. At my previous co-op at Harvard Law School, I was an Information Technology Specialist and learned a lot about managing technology, troubleshooting, and being resourceful. One of our responsibilities was to tend to and maintain the printers, which we had to reload with paper and solve any problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            We pushed management for a project, so they let us complete this project. We used HTML, Python, and CSS to style a form to fill out during our daily printer check. We then used that data to find trends and report to management so they could prepare for these trends. It was a lot of fun figuring out how to accomplish this project because there was no rubric and it was open-ended. We spent several days writing on whiteboards to plan the project and how we were going to execute.
